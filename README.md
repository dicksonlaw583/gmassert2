# GMAssert v2.0.0

Assertion scripts for GameMaker Studio 2.2

```
assert_not_equal("untested code", "good code", "You should have used GMAssert!");
```

## Introduction

GMAssert is a library containing useful assertions for debugging and automated unit testing. You can use it to alert you to undesirable runtime conditions, pause the debugger at that point for further inspection, or quickly test code for expected behaviour.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 2.2.5 or below

Please use GMAssert 2.1.0 or above for GameMaker Studio 2.3.0 or higher.

If you use GameMaker Studio 1.4, please see [GMAssert Legacy](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmassert-legacy).

## Installation

Download [v2.0.0](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmassert2/releases/tag/v2.0.0) from the release pages. For documentation, please use the `docs.zip` that comes with the release, **not** the current Wiki.

Also available on the [the YoYo Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8164/gmassert).

*Optional:* If you wish to use the debugger or customize failure handling behaviour, export the extension's included `__GMA_BREAKPOINT__` script and follow the instructions inside.
